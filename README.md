# dialogue-player-unity

A Unity runtime for Portrait dialogues. Compatible with the JSON format used for `portrait-one` and the dialogue editor.

Videos must be placed in `Resources/videos`. Unity only supports `.mov` files for video, but for `.m4v` files you may be able to simply change their extension without needing to transcode them.

Scripts are supported; add new entries to `DialogueScripts.cs`.
